# SquidNet2
The sequel to SquidNet. It has many of the previous features that were in the original script, however a lot of the functions that do not serve much functionality have been removed.

# Main Features:
* Remote access connection  - Control the bots when they connect to the botnet.
* BotNet Admin              - The one and only account on the server that can control the bots.
* FTP Possiblites           - Files can be extracted from the bots into the server directory, where the admin can extract the files inside of that directory.
* DDoS Attacks              - Conduct DDoS Attacks using the bots that you have in your fingertips. Make sure to have permission from the domain you are attacking!
* Config File               - It is rather inconvinient to constantly have to enter the information with option parsing, so instead a config file can save you from all of that trouble.
* More Optimised            - The script is more optimized, so that it is less likely to slow down or accumalate errors like the original.
* Logic From DatCord        - A lot of the functions use the same logic from DatCord, so that the script is as optimized and efficient as it can be.
* Logging                   - Everything on the server is logged(except for the passwords), including errors and connections.
* RansomWare Script         - A ransomware script that can encrypt all of the bots files, and are needed to enter the correct key to decrypt them all.
* Focusing Connections      - Focus on one bot at a time, if that is needed.
